        <p>Welcome! We are Verdant Tracks. A study group originating from
            APEC Schools Sta Rita! Our handle is based on the topic of Bike lanes,
            how we can improve it, what you need to know if you're only starting to
            use the highway, and also discusses the issues and dangers faced when
            using these lanes. Get to know more about us as we cycle our way through
            this rocky journey together! üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí®</p>

        <p>The streaming outline is the list of events that will happen on the stream, it contains the introduction, the main content and the conclusion. As stated in the stream outline, we will spend the first minute introducing our group and each individual member. For the second minute, we will give a brief overview of bike lanes, from their various types to how they are used. For the next eight and a half minutes, we will then highlight the issues with the current bike lanes in the Philippines. For another five minutes, we will give out safety tips on using bike lanes. The last minute will then be allotted to concluding everything that has been previously discussed. Our stream will come to a total of approximately 16 minutes and 20 seconds.</p>

        <h2>I. Summary Of Stream</h2>
        <p>The person who handled the livestream (OBS, graphics, & etc.) was Kezia. Nico was watching the stream in a viewer POV
            to ensure and alert if there are any technical difficulties in the stream. The spokespersons of the stream were Armando,
            Jewel, Antonio & Kezia. Sofia was handling the chat, asking questions in the live comments to keep interactions up.
            Glen was unfortunately busy that day and was absent during the stream.


        The stream started at 10 am with the ‚ÄòGetting Ready‚Äô screen. After 3 minutes of waiting, the stream trailer played for 2
            minutes. Then the stream officially started at 10:05 with greetings from the spokespersons of the stream. They ask the
            audience how their day was and how the trailer was. At 8:56 of the stream, Kezia flashes the ‚ÄúBe Right Back‚Äù screen and
            apparently, we forgot to mute the background noise. After around 2 minutes, we move on to our ice breaker as a fun activity
            and to also break the awkwardness of the stream. After the icebreaker, we move on to play our pre-recorded video for an
            introduction of the main discussion which is about bike lanes at 15:38 of the stream. Then, we proceeded to the main topic
            about our stream which is the bike lanes, where we discussed the problems of bike lanes and also addressed how to solve
            those problems while talking with the live viewers throughout the live stream until the stream ended.</p>

        <h2>II. Strongest Portions of the Stream</h2>
        <p>Among the many moments in our stream, there are specific parts that peak in our
            lives, one of which begins around 20:00. In this segment, our members begin to share their biking experiences,
            making it practical and casual while also increasing engagement with the audience, allowing them to share their
            experiences in the chat as well. These interactions go on and on as some viewers share their experiences and the
            members having a similar situation results in similarities and relatable experiences to share and compare with
            the audience; making more interaction possible and reactions ongoing.</p>

        <h2>III. Shortcomings of the Stream</h2>
        <p>In our stream, there were a lot of flaws that had happened. We also had a lot of opportunities to improve our stream
            like the following:
            - All spokespersons are present on the stream.
            - Given more facts and tips for bikes and bike lanes.
            - Promoted our website.
            - Improve handling the streaming software.
            - Have a guest on the stream.

    <section id="audience-engagement">
        <h2>IV. Audience Engagement</h2>
        <p>There were several segments in our stream that required audience engagement to function
            properly, such as the 'Ice breaker,' 'Audience Feedback,' and 'Audience Experiences.' Fortunately, there were a good
            number of people in the chat box who participated in the activities we had prepared for them. We were able to relate
            to each other's experiences while also gaining new and unique perspectives.</p>

    <section id="viewership-rating">
        <h2>V. Viewership rating</h2>
        <p>In our livestream, we had an average of 9 viewers with the peak viewership of 13.
            For our VOD (video on demand) as of now; Monday March, 4, 4:16 PM, we have 77 views on our stream VOD.
           
            For us as a company, we see this as low viewership. The reason behind this was from the lack of followers and
            subscribers. We failed to advertise our channel properly so with that we didn‚Äôt reach the expected viewership
            during our stream, with poor planning and busy schedules we completely neglected promoting our stream because
            it seems our old promotion wasn‚Äôt that effective enough to guarantee success.</p>

        <section><h1>Summary of Stream </h1>
        <p>   The person who handled the technical aspects of the livestream (OBS, graphics, & etc.)
            was Nico. While the spokespersons of the stream were Armando, Jewel, Antonio, Glen, and Jazlyn. Sofia was handling the chat, asking questions in the live comments to keep interactions up. Both her and Nico were watching the stream in a viewer POV to ensure that we were alerted if there were any technical difficulties during the stream.
           
            The stream started at 4:00 pm with the ‚ÄòGetting Ready‚Äô screen. After 2 minutes of waiting, the short intro played for 3 minutes. The stream then officially began at 4:05 pm with greetings from the spokespersons of the stream. They asked the audience how their day was and introduced themselves to the audience. We then move on to our ice breaker as a fun activity and to also break the awkwardness of the stream. After the ice breaker, we recapped a few happenings about the previous stream to remember what we learned previously and to expand more on the topic with both the new and the experienced hosts. After recapping, we talked to our audience about our findings with our research interview and shared the results through a series of graphs. After discussing the results of our survey, we moved on to the main event of the stream. We invited a special guest: Jeanne Soleil Cervantes, a grade 7 student-athlete, to start talking about all things cycling and road safety. The hosts asked a set of questions that will allow her to share more about her personal experiences as a competitive racer and also as a regular day-to-day cyclist. Besides the questions we had prepared beforehand, some of the viewers were also asking follow up questions in the chat box. The hosts made sure that most of the questions were answered and they relayed them to the guest speaker. After that our guest left, we did a little recap of everything we went through for the past 50 minutes. We then bid our goodbyes and ended our stream.
            </p></section>
        <section><h1>Strongest Portions of the Stream</h1>
        <p>There are specific portions of our stream that were stronger than others. One of which
            begins around 13:02. In this segment, our members shared their research findings to the audience. The second strong portion is at 30:10 where our members introduced the special guest speaker for the stream: Jeanne Soleil "Jes-c" Cervantes. Jewel, Armando, Jazlyn, Antonio, ang Glen asked Jes-c about her career, experiences, and background as a cyclist. These are the portions that drew in the largest amount of audience engagement.
            </p></section>
        <section><h1>Shortcomings of the Stream </h1>
      <p>Though the group has tried their best to reflect and learn from the mistakes that occurred
        from the debut stream, there will always still be room for improvement. Here are a few things that would‚Äôve been better if it had gone differently:</p></section>
        <section><p><h5>Handling of steaming software.</h5> As Nico is new to OBS, he went through a
            learning curb like everyone else usually does. We struggled with navigating the wide array of features, especially with setting up the webcam and chat box. With more time to practice and explore the software, the overall quality of our stream may have been improved.</p></section>
        <section><p><h5>Better equipment.</h5>We struggled with setting up our microphone and constantly had
                issues with connecting it to our device. The quality of our laptop‚Äôs camera wasn‚Äôt the greatest either. Due to the quality of our mic, there would be occasional static sounds coming from it that weren‚Äôt exactly pleasant to the ears. We wish we had a better quality set up to lessen the technical difficulties we had to deal with.</p></section>
        <section><p><h5>Rehearsals.</h5>We held a dry run and even invited our guest speaker in hopes of being able
                   to get familiar with the flow of the stream. But due to the technical difficulties we faced on our part, we didn‚Äôt actually get to do any rehearsals and our guest was there to witness all the chaos that was a result of lack of preparation. The entire rehearsal time was instead used as time to set up the OBS that should‚Äôve been dealt with days before.
                    </p></section>
        <section><p><h5>Dead air.</h5>As we weren‚Äôt able to do proper rehearsals, everyone was nervous.
                        Everyone, especially the main hosts were kind of going through a mental block and struggled with thinking of ways to fill in the dead air. There were many awkward, silent moments. With more practice, the overall atmosphere would‚Äôve been less tense. The hosts would‚Äôve been more comfortable and natural. Instead, we relied on our script and sounded somewhat monotone. The latency delay didn‚Äôt help much either. Especially after our guest speaker left, we finished all our segments earlier than anticipated and didn‚Äôt have anything prepared to fill in the remaining time. We no longer knew how to entertain our audience so we decided to end our stream 10 minutes early.
                        </p></section>
        <h1>Audience Engagement</h1>
        <section><p>During the majority of our live stream, the audience played a major role. For instance, a
            portion of our stream during which audience interaction was essential was the icebreaker. Luckily, quite a few individuals took part in it. Even during the interview with our guest speaker, the audience was able to ask our guest speaker any questions they desired. They were also able to show their support to our hosts and especially the guest speaker. Overall, we appreciate the help and encouragement we received from those who watched our stream. The audience was engaged for the whole duration of our stream, which enhanced  the  enjoyment and made it more lively for both the hosts and the viewers.
            </p></section>
            <section><p><h1>Viewership rating</h1>On our re-stream, we had an average of  16 viewers with a peak viewership of 22.
                For our VOD (video on demand) as of now: we have 198 views.
               
                We had only an average of 9 watchers on our previous stream, with a peak of 13, and 77
                views on its VOD. This demonstrates that, in contrast to the last time, we gathered more viewership and improved our advertising. We do think we managed to meet the expectations as a small company this time around. All this was also made possible with our guest speaker, Jes-c. A good percentage of the audience was there just to watch and support her. We hope to improve more in the future and grow to spread awareness of the issue that we are fighting against.
